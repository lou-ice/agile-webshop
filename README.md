# Agile Webshop

This is a school group project focused on learning agile development. While the coding aspect was included, our primary emphasis was on mastering agile methodologies. This experience enhanced our understanding of agile practices and their application in real-world projects.

#### Scrum

#### React

#### Bootstrap
